When programming in Python, follow these instructions:

1. Use the 'templateForTesting.py' file as a template
2. BEFORE you start writing your methods, write a test function for each method using the expected outcomes 
from this method and make sure it FAILS (run the file directly to run the tests)
3. Write your class methods
4. Test again and make sure every test PASSES
5. Properly document your code and commit to GitHub
6. ???
7. Profit

NOTE: Run the python file directly to perform the tests, use your class in another file to actually run your code

NOTE: There are many more functions in the 'unittest.py' module, see documentation below
